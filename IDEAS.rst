Enhancement and Improvement Ideas
=================================

* Support for multiplication and division in PFMod rule action ``set_<arbitrary_integer_metadata>``, e.g. ``set_risk_score: *2``. (Would have to deal with divide by zero conditions and floating point numbers.)

* Support relative dates/ranges, e.g. ``created_at >= 4w``; support a ``NOW`` dynamic variable?
