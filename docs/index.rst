Summary
=======

Aristotle is a simple yet powerful Python program that enables the filtering
and manipulating of Suricata and Snort rulesets based on explicit and induced
metadata for each rule.
It can be thought of as a "Swiss Army Knife" to enable, disable, augment, curate, and tune
rulesets so they can be optimized for particular environments, resulting in
enhanced alert outputs and a reduction in false positives.
Aristotle  can be run as a standalone script or utilized as a module.
