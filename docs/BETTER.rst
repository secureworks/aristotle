.. rubric:: Better Enhanced Teleological and Taxonomic Embedded Rules Schema

Summary
=======

This document defines a schema and standard for embedding metadata
in intrusion detection system (IDS) rules.  The discussed metadata
is composed as key-value pairs and is primarily intended to
communicate teleological and taxonomic information about the rule
in which it resides.

Background
==========

Problem
-------

As network bandwidth increases, attack methodologies expand, malicious
traffic patterns fluctuate, and IDS ruleset sizes grow, the ability
to programmatically understand the taxonomic and teleological
characteristics of each IDS rule becomes invaluable. The decades-old
practices of maintaining a rigid classification.config file and
segregating rules into distinct files is onerous, not scalable, and, in
many deployments, inviable for accurate ruleset tuning.
Simply enabling all available IDS rules is rarely wise, prudent, or
feasible for those concerned about rule performance, false-positives,
volume, and value. There needs to be an easy way to "slice and dice"
large rulesets so that they can be customized for each particular
deployment.

Solution
--------

Embed metadata key-value pairs in each rule that can be programmatically
consumed to enable powerful ruleset optimization.

Schema
======

Version
-------

This document defines version 1.0, released October 2019.

Scope
-----

While the remainder of this document focuses on the ``metadata`` keyword
supported by the `Suricata <https://suricata-ids.org/>`__ and
`Snort <https://www.snort.org/>`__ IDS engines, its applicability
should not be considered restricted to just those technologies, but can
apply to rules for other IDS engines if they support similar
capabilities.

Overview
--------

The `Suricata metadata
keyword <https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules/meta.html?highlight=metadata#metadata>`__
and `Snort metadata
keyword <http://manual-snort-org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node31.html#SECTION00448000000000000000>`__
allow for non-functional (in terms of detection) information to be
included (embedded) within a rule. The contents of the
``metadata`` keyword can be structured as comma separated key-value pairs.

Details
-------

This schema defines a key-value pair structure in the ``metadata`` keyword
for Suricata and Snort rules. The key-value pairs within the value of the
``metadata`` keyword are defined as comma separated, with a space separating
the key and value, and the key being the first word.

Regarding the ``metadata`` keyword values:

-  Key names and values are case insensitive and should be interpreted
   as such.
-  Key names and values should only contain printable ASCII characters.
-  Key names and values should be separated by a single space (ASCII
   0x20).
-  Whitespace before or after key names and key values should be ignored.
-  Key names should only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
   and underscore ('\_'); and should not start with a number.
-  Key values must not contain commas (','), semicolons (';'), or
   double quotes ('"'), but may include spaces (' '), dashes ('-'), etc.
-  Key values must not begin with '<' (ASCII 0x3C) or '>' (ASCII 0x3E).
-  The key name "sid" is reserved and should not be used unless the
   value of the key is the same as that of the ``sid`` keyword in the
   rule.
-  Characters, character locations, character combinations, etc. that
   are not supported by the IDS engine as values to the ``metadata`` keyword
   are implicitly not allowed.

A rules file should designate what schema and version its containing
rules support. This should be specified in the file before any rules are
specified, using the format:

``<comment_character(s)>better-schema<space><version>``

Example:

``#better-schema 1.0``

Keys and Values
---------------

This document attempts to canonize specific key names and, where it make
sense, define a finite set of values or particular value format. The key
names defined here should not be considered to be comprehensive and in
fact, the use of custom keys is encouraged as long as they conform to
this standard and do not conflict with the nomenclature and purpose of
the keys already defined here. Ruleset creators are encouraged to
implement as many of these keys as are applicable, although none are
required.

Note that many keys can have multiple entries (i.e. logically, multiple
values). This one-to-many relationship is not only allowed, but
necessary to fully take advantage of the flexibility of this schema.

     - Protocol(s) the rule is attempting to inspect.

       There is no distinction of type, function, layer, etc.

       Since it is generally assumed in this context, Internet Protocol (IP) is not included unless it is specified in the rule (e.g. ``alert ip ...``)

       The protocol “tls” includes SSL; there should not be a bifurcation having SSL and TLS.

     - Defines what type asset is protected by this rule.
       Typically in the format of ``<protocol>-server`` or ``<protocol>-client``,
       with <protocol> not including layer 4 and below. One notable exception
       is ``database-server``.

       ``tls`` includes SSL. Note that ``tls-server`` and ``http-server``
       are distinct (same for ``tls-client`` and ``tls-server``).

     - If a rule detects on malware traffic, it should have a ``malware``
       key (it may also have a malware related ``cwe_id`` and/or ``capec_id`` key).

       This is not designed to label specific malware or malware families, but
       to identify the rule as malware related and communicate broad malware
       function. See `Appendix A <#appendixa>`__ for details on example values.
   * - **cve**
     - 2015-0235

       2019-10149

     - For Suricata and Snort, this corresponds directly with “priority” keyword in the rule: high = 1; medium = 2; low = 3; info = 4; research = 5.

       See `Appendix B <#appendixb>`__ for details.
   * - **hostile**
     - src_ip

       dest_ip
     - Which side of the alert is considered “hostile” (i.e. attacker, C2, etc.)

       This is the inverse of the “target” Suricata rule
       keyword (`<https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-4.1.4/rules/meta.html#target>`__).
   * - **infected**
     - src_ip

       dest_ip
     - Which side of the alert is the malware-infected host. Should only be present on malware-related rules.

   * - **classtype**
     - trojan-activity

       shellcode-detect

       policy-violation
     - Same as what is/would be found in the ``classtype`` rule keyword. Defined to help provide legacy compatibility mapping.

   * - **rule_source**
     - secureworks

       emerging-threats
     - Vendor name or other identifier to label the source, author, and/or curator of the rule.
   * - **sid**
     - 8675309
     - If used, the value of the key must be the same as that of the ``sid`` keyword in the
       rule and since this is redundant, the use of the “sid” key is not recommended.

.. note::
    The values shown for the ``priority``, ``hostile``, and ``infected`` keys are the complete list for those keys.


Examples
========

These examples help illustrate the concepts discussed in this document.
Also, the structures in the `Suricata EVE
JSON <https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html>`__ log
snippets show how the
metadata key-value pairs should be logically interpreted.

Example 1
---------

This ``metadata`` keyword in a rule:

::

  metadata:cwe_id 20,cvss_v3_base 7.3,hostile src_ip,created_at 2019-06-01,capec_id 248,updated_at 2019-06-11,
  filename exploit.rules,priority medium,rule_source acme-rule-factory,cvss_v2_base 8.1,attack_target server,
  attack_target smtp-server,cvss_v3_temporal 7.1,cve 2019-91325,cvss_v2_temporal 7.9,mitre_attack t1190,
  protocols smtp,protocols tcp;

Results in this in the Suricata EVE JSON log:

This ``metadata`` keyword in a rule:

::

  metadata:cwe_id 507,malware post-infection,hostile dest_ip,created_at 2016-03-21,updated_at 2016-04-02,
  filename acme.rules,priority high,infected src_ip,rule_source acme-rule-factory,attack_target http-client,
  attack_target client,mitre_attack t1094,protocols http,protocols tcp;
